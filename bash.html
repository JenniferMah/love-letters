		 	BASH. 
		 	<br>
		 	I can’t keep seeing you. Your every <span class="word"> touch </span> creates new files that create problems. You use <span class="word"> mkdir </span> to create new directories that make the maze of files even more complex. I don’t know if I should <span class="word">cd</span> through all the directories you have put me through to get to the files I want. I can't list out all the problems like you can with <span class="word"> ls </span>.
		 	<br>
		 	You tried to show me how I could change your files through <span class="word"> nano </span> but it just wasn’t enough… I don’t know why I keep trying to use <span class="word"> pwd </span> to find out where we are… You always seem to overcomplicate everything from uploading to the server through terminal by forcing me open two terminal windows then typing my username and password to log into the server remotly. Then in the other terminal window finding my local page and using <span class="word">scp </span> to upload with my idenikey and password agian.
		 	<br>
		 	You are always playing games when I type <span class="word"> emacs </span> then hit Function+F10,then ‘t’ you turn into an impssible puzzle to solve.
		 	<br>
		 	You have so many secret navigational commands, even when I try to use <span class="word"> autocomplete </span> you frustrate me with all the wrong options. 
		 	Every little typo or mistake I make always leads to a series of error messages that you love to spit out at me. Even though we look cool together at that cool hipster coffee shop you’re just too high maintenance for me.
		 	<br>
		 	I would rather use <span class="word"> cowsay </span>installed through homebrew to talk with cows than to talk with you agian.
		 	<br>
		 	Bye.

		 	Jen
